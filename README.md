# Hello! My name is Dimitri

I’m a frontend dev since 2019.

I live in France, in a city surrounded by mountains: Grenoble. 🏔️

I adore the exercice of making well-crafted software and share about it.

And on a more personal note: I’m learning Japanese and sign language, I love music, animal welfare matters deeply to me and my last name translates with executioner. 🙃
